# Analyze A/B Test Results
## by (Mohamed Hossam El_Din)

A project from **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**.


## Preview

>For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

>The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.



## project specifications


>The project is well organized through a **jupyter notebook**.

>All code cells can run without errors

>There is a satisfying answer or explanation after each question or result.


## The result

Generally, from this A/B Test we had no evidence that the new page led to more conversions than the old page since it appeared more than once that the page is not statistically significant. Moreover, we can say it had negative effect on the conversion rate as the observed difference between the new-page rate and the old-page rate is negative. One thought is to keep both the pages for more time and then test again. Also this conclusion may differ if we consider other factors like the timestamp.
